            Add some debugging logic to attempt to capture some pesky
            &quot;server did not respond to the image request&quot; errors that
            some people are encountering. Pretty sure it&apos;s something on my
            end and not with the Stable Horde cluster.

            Small design change to <Linker href="/paint">paint page</Linker> to
            make toolbar and overall theme more consistent across dark / light

            NEW FEATURE: ðŸŽ¨ <Linker href="/paint">Painting!</Linker> You can now
            paint your own images and then send them to the img2img feature.
            <AddedInfo>
              Turn your cheesy drawings into awesome AI generated art. This is
              somewhat in beta as I&apos;m working out some kinks with the
              painting library{' '}
              <Linker href="http://fabricjs.com/" target="_blank">
                (Fabric.js)
              </Linker>
              . This should also lay the groundwork for inpainting support once
              the Stable Horde cluster supports it.

            Show source image on details page if an image was generated via
            img2img. Also added an upload icon in the top right corner of this
            source image, so you can quickly create / modify a new prompt using
            the original image.

            <AddedInfo>
              Currently locked to system settings, but I will add an option for
              user preference in the future.

            <Linker href="/">main create page</Linker>.
            <AddedInfo>
              The thinking here is to simplify the front page as much as
              possible. If someone has no experience with generative AI art, let
              them quickly create something.

          <StyledLi>
            Fixed: issue where choosing a model (e.g., stable_diffusion) would
            get saved as a variable for samplers, resulting in payload
            validation errors from the API. This is why testing your code is
            important. Ah hem.

            <AddedInfo>
              Relates to future feature that will attempt to detect if job has
              gone stale and attempt to retry / resubmit

          <StyledLi>
            You can now import images directly from a URL in order to use the
            img2img feature with stable diffusion.
          </StyledLi>
          <StyledLi>
            In the models dropdown list, you can now see the number of workers
            running each model
            <AddedInfo>
              More workers generally means quicker generation times. This is
              helpful if you want to crank through a number of images.

            Add option to download PNG of your image
            <AddedInfo>
              Due to bandwidth constraints, the Stable Horde sends images as a
              WEBP file. This isn&apos;t always optimal for downloading to your
              local device. On each image details page, you will see a download
              button (down arrow).
