              at the moment and I am waiting on a more solid resolution. It may

              Due to the release of Stable Diffusion 2.0 by Stability.Ai, there
              is a lot of interest in generating images with the new model. The
              Stable Horde API has been under heavy load and requests are taking
              longer than usual.

            Stability.Ai released their Stable Diffusion 2.0 model yesterday.
            The model was quickly added to Stable Horde and due to increased
            demand, the cluster has been under a pretty heavy load (all Stable
            Horde UIs seem to be slow lately). Things seem to be getting a bit
            better, but requests are still a bit slow. You can try out the new

            Stable Horde (especially if you are generating and checking a number
            of image requests). This makes it easy to inadvertently hit a rate
            limit and get unexplained errors. Now, API calls will only happen in
            the active browser tab. Things should be much smoother now. Thanks
            to &quot;webhead&quot; on Discord for helping me to track this down.

            Made a number of improvements to pending items page, such as filters
            and options to edit or retry image requests when an error is
            detected from the Stable Horde API.

            Thanks to some refactored logic with the pending items queue,

            Fix: issue where clicking &quot;reroll&quot; on an image created
